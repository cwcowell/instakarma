The main focus of instakarma is thanking or acknowledging other Instabasers by giving karma to a coworker.

Let's see how it works.

Let's say Jean approved my last-minute PTO request...

    @jean ++

Now let's say Jean denied my attempt to expense PTO airplane tickets to Hawaii! The nerve of her. I might try to take karma away from her...

    @jean --

But as you can see, you can't karma way from people.

You can give karma to non-people, such as a place, a product, or a technology, or anything, really.

    pie++

If the thing contains a space, use a hyphen instead.

    the-beatles++

We saw that you can't take karma away from people, but you can take it away from things...

    cilantro--

Or if I'm having a rough time figuring out a programming problem, I can let the world know

    javascript--

So those are the main operations.

But instakarma also has slash commands, similar to what you've used with other Slack apps...

    /instakarma my-stats

This command shows how much karma you have, the five people or things you've given the most karma to, and the five things you've taken away the most karma from.

You can see a list of all non-people and how much karma they have, which is a fun way to judge what your coworkers are happy or upset about...

    /instakarma leaderboard

If you don't like the whole idea of granting karma, you can opt out of the system entirely...

    /instakarma opt-out

When you're opted out, you can't grant or receive karma.

    @anant++

But you can change your mind and opt back in...

    /instakarma opt-in

And then everything goes back to normal...

    @anant++

If you forget how to use instakarma, it's easy to get help.

    /instakarma help

There are also some administration tools for doing things like backing up the instakarma database or exporting karma to other formats, but those are only interesting to the instakarma administrator, so I won't bother showing them here.
